# ChargedRingInduction

A ring charged with a current "I" is considered. The ring induction for certain points in R3 is calculated and plotted.

The 2D plot file plots the vector field on a plane (x,y,z=const) and also plots the induction on (0,0,z). The 3D graphic file shows the vector field of the induction produced by the ring in space.
